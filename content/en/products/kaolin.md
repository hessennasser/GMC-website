## Description
### Color Dark White, sometimes red, blue or brown tints from impurities.
Kaolinite is a clay mineral, part of the group of industrial minerals, with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5(OH)4.
It is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet of silica (SiO4) linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina (AlO6).
Kaolinite has a low shrink–swell capacity and a low cation-exchange capacity (1–15 meq/100 g). It is a soft, earthy, usually white grades,
mineral (decahedral phyllosilicate clay), produced by the chemical weathering of aluminum silicate minerals like feldspar.
Commercial grades of kaolin are supplied and transported as dry powder.
